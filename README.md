 Door/ Portal that transport to the main stage or diffenrent scenes, where we have several object that makes the player can interact with it. For example, the player can grab objects an depends on the distance that are near to the headseat simulate that you eat it make, aftear that you will be smaller or bigger (like the film, that are a bottle and cake).
The player can move or teleport to certain destination.
The player will dispose a menu that can spawn some objects and so more (to define).
